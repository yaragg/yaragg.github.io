	<p>This was a homework assignment for my Interactive Media Development class.</p>

	<p>It was written in <em>Processing</em>. We were asked to make an animation with randomly generated elements: in my case, the birds' movement follows two Perlin noise sequences, the clouds are generated using directed randomness and the trees are created using a Gaussian curve.</p>
