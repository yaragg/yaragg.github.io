	<p>This unnamed project was a three-person team project for a Game Design &amp; Development course in the University of SÃ£o Paulo. </p>

	<p>It is a dungeon crawler with randomized maps, turn based battles and a plot inspired by Greek Mythology. It was developed entirely in <em>RPG Maker VX Ace</em>.</p>

	<p>It can be downloaded <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/61hnu3cs842p67l/Dungeon%20Crawler.exe?dl=0">here</a>. It is in English and playable on Windows only.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><em>Time.</em> It was a mid term project, so we had a little less than three months to make the game.</li>
		<li><em>Team play.</em> The other members didn't have much time to dedicate to the project, so we had to try to make up for it.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>My part in it</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><em>Concept.</em></li>
		<li><em>Story and writing.</em> I came up with the main storyline, developed it and wrote the introduction as well as most of the cutscenes.</li>
		<li><em>Soundtrack.</em> I picked the soundtrack, using royalty free music found online as well as RPG Maker VX Ace assets.</li>
		<li><em>Programming.</em> I am experienced with RPG Maker in general, so I handled most of the events and scripts.</li>
	</ul>
